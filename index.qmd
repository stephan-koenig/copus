## Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS)

Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) captures the activities of instructors and students during a class [@smith2013].
The protocol strictly quantifies the time spent on these activities and not the quality of instruction.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false
#| message: false

library(conflicted)
library(here)

source(here("R", "functions.R"))

copus <- process_copus(here("data", "raw"), here("data", "codes.csv"))
```

Codes were further collapsed [@smith2014].
